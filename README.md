## About The Project

Nimbus-IaaS bridges the gap between local development and global access. It leverages the power of **Vagrant** to provision and manage virtual machines on your local PC and uses **FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy)** to tunnel traffic, giving each VM a public-facing port. This eliminates the need for expensive cloud providers for development, testing, or personal projects that require public accessibility.

The entire system is controlled by a robust **FastAPI** backend and a responsive **React** frontend, providing a seamless, cloud-like experience for managing your local infrastructure.

## Key Features

-   **üñ•Ô∏è Full VM Lifecycle Management**: Create, start, stop, and delete VirtualBox VMs directly from the web UI.
-   **üîë SSH Key Management**: Generate new SSH key pairs or use existing ones for secure VM access.
-   **üåê Global Accessibility**: Each VM service is exposed via a public IP and port, managed by an FRP tunnel.
-   **üîí Dynamic Firewall Control**: Manage inbound rules for each VM in real-time. Changes are automatically synced with your cloud provider's (AWS) security group.
-   **üìú Provisioning Scripts**: Bootstrap your VMs with custom shell scripts on creation.
-   **‚ú® Modern UI**: A clean, responsive, and intuitive interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed and configured on your host machine:

-   **Python** (v3.8+) and `pip`
-   **Node.js** (v16+) and `npm`
-   **Vagrant**
-   **Oracle VirtualBox**
-   **FRP Server (frps)**: You must have an `frps` server running on a cloud instance (like an AWS EC2 t2.micro) with a public IP.
    -   Your EC2 instance's security group must allow traffic on the `frps` port (default `7000`) and the range of ports you intend to use for tunnels (e.g., `2222-3000`).
-   **AWS CLI**: Configured with credentials that have permission to manage EC2 Security Groups.

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/nimbus-iaas.git](https://github.com/your-username/nimbus-iaas.git)
    cd nimbus-iaas
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    # (Assuming your main.py is in the root or a 'backend' folder)

    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

    # Install Python dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Configure FRP Client
    # Edit frpc.toml and set the 'serverAddr' to your cloud instance's public IP.

    # Run the backend server
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend server will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the frontend directory
    cd nimbus-iaas-frontend

    # Install NPM packages
    npm install

    # Start the development server
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
