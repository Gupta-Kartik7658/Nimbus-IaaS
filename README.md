Nimbus-IaaS is a lightweight **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** platform that allows you to create, manage, and expose local VirtualBox VMs to the internet through a modern web interface. It mimics cloud-like VM provisioning and management while running entirely on your machine.

## About The Project

Nimbus-IaaS bridges the gap between **local development** and **global accessibility**. Using **Vagrant** and **VirtualBox**, it provisions VMs on your local PC. The **FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy)** tunnel exposes each VM to a public-facing port, allowing secure access without expensive cloud infrastructure.

A **FastAPI backend** manages authentication, VM orchestration, SSH keys, and firewall rules, while a **React frontend** provides a responsive, cloud-like UI for managing your local infrastructure.

All communications are secured with **HTTPS** and **SSL/TLS**, and network access is controlled via **AWS Security Groups** for any tunneled ports.

---

## Key Features

- üñ•Ô∏è **Full VM Lifecycle Management**: Create, start, stop, and delete VMs directly from the web UI.
- üîë **SSH Key Management**: Generate or manage SSH key pairs for secure VM access.
- üåê **Global Accessibility**: Each VM is exposed via a public IP and port, securely tunneled through FRP.
- üîí **Dynamic Firewall Control**: Add or remove inbound rules for each VM in real-time; rules automatically sync with AWS Security Groups.
- üìú **Provisioning Scripts**: Bootstrap VMs with custom shell scripts on creation.
- ‚ú® **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive, and intuitive interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.

## System Architecture

The architecture of Nimbus-IaaS is designed to emulate cloud-like VM provisioning while running locally:

![System Architecture](SystemDiagram2Dark.png)

**Highlights:**

- **Frontend (Vercel)**: Hosted with a custom domain and SSL for HTTPS access.
- **Cloud Gateway (EC2)**: Acts as a reverse proxy and secure entry point, managing FRP tunneling.
- **Backend (FastAPI)**: Runs locally, orchestrates VM creation, SSH keys, and dynamic firewall rules.
- **Local VMs (Vagrant + VirtualBox)**: VMs are provisioned locally and exposed publicly through FRP tunnels.

**Security Highlights:**

- End-to-end HTTPS/TLS encryption
- JWT-based authentication for users
- Per-user SSH key management
- EC2 Security Groups control exposed ports
- FRP tunnels hide local infrastructure

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- **Python** with **FastAPI**
- **Vagrant** for VM provisioning
- **Oracle VirtualBox** for virtualization
- **FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy)** for public tunneling
- **Boto3** for AWS Security Group management
- **SQLite + SQLAlchemy** for VM and user data storage

### Frontend

- **React (Vite)**
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Axios** for API communication

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Node.js 16+ and npm**
- **Vagrant**
- **Oracle VirtualBox**
- **FRP Server** running on a cloud instance (e.g., AWS EC2)
  - Ensure the EC2 security group allows traffic on the FRP port (default 7000) and the range of VM ports (e.g., 2222-3000)
- **AWS CLI** configured with credentials that can manage EC2 Security Groups

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gupta-Kartik7658/Nimbus-IaaS.git
cd Nimbus-IaaS
```

2. **Backend Setup**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure frpc.toml with your FRP server public IP
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The backend runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

3. **Frontend Setup**
```bash
cd nimbus-iaas-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend is available at `http://localhost:8080`.
